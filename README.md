# WORK IN PROGRESS ( Not any trained model available yet / Code still in progress )


# About this project 
This is a first implementation of a Colorization Diffusion Based Method

# Reference

Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05233.pdf 

The Unet Network script directly comes from the repo of this last : https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion (with small modifications according to the Palette paper)

A colorization Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/shravankumar9892/image-colorization ( Palette paper's researchers uses ImageNet )
